# CTFGame
An open source Capture the Flag project to practice networking in Unreal Engine. It's currently work in progress and I plan on to finish it before 15th of January.
The game is in 1920x1080 resolution currently only available for Windows builds.

Currently available:
"Click any key to continue" screen
Main menu with create game*, join game** and quit buttons
*Create game button creates a session and opens lobby widget
**Join game button opens the Join Game widget*
*Join Game widget has a back button and a search for game button. Search for game button lists first 5 sessions found in a button, and upon clicking the button player joins the session. 

Currently, sessions don't do anything. Next up, I'll set up seamless travel to gameplay level. Then I'll be implementing a full 1v1 Capture the Flag gameplay.
